# OTSERV AUTOMATION

This is a simple automation to get a otserv up and running based on Docker/Docker-compose.

## Requirements
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and docker-compose
- Inside folder volume/data/world unzip the .zip file named map1.zip to map1.otbm (large files restriction)

## Getting started
```sh
docker-compose up
```

## Getting connected
You should have a tibia client to connect on it, I recommend using the free, open source, community driven [client](https://github.com/edubart/otclient).
Point to your IP (a.k.a localhost) and port (defaut 7171) then connect with the god account (god/god).

## Configs
There is an account management system (ZNote AAC), refer to the ZNote repo to find instructions of the usage.
